/* 
 * This class draws relations between expansions and characters. How do I want to code this though? If I put this with a front-end, maybe they
 * click on the character and relations are shown as a list?
 * Do they type the name of the character and an array of characters pop-up?
 * Instead of Relations I could provide scenarios for people to play with, already with a small story, villain, and hero team. Or small
 * campaigns up to 5 matches with small storylines and possible hero teams. I think I like this better since relations is a little too vague.
