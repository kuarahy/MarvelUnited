public class Scenarios {
    /* How to write connections between characters using data?
     * I could create a list of possible smaller villains to start a campaign
     * I could also create a list of all villains to create a random campaign
     * I create straight relations in relational data to fetch teams of villains
     * and heroes
     * I could create a storyline and randomize each villain too
     * How about storylines that have different branches depending on possibilities?
     * I probably should extend Scenarios to each scenario so they are more readable
